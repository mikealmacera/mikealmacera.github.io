Apart from having an attraction to typesetting all my problem sets on LaTeX and writing on chalkboards, here are some of my personal interests!

Coffee
=====
Growing up, I got into drinking coffee quite early. I used to spend hours figuring out how to draw latte art by pouring cold milk on my drip coffee (this is impossible)...

Now, I have an espresso machine and small little coffee bar next to my chalkboard and whiteboard. I mainly make americanos as that is what my family is used to. I personally love to make cortados!

Music
=====
I enjoy producing music from time to time using FL Studio. I got into producing during COVID when I was not able to perform and teach piano in-person. I joined a few Discord servers with friends in the hyperpop/underground communities. I mainly produce EDM, hyperpop, and trap music but I love to experiment with other genres (plugg, jerk, anything "new wave"). I seldom DJ.

Chess
=====
My father signed me up for Chess lessons when I was very young. I still play Chess (mainly online although I LOVE to play OTB). My puzzles rating is 4500+. I also enjoy various kinds of puzzles including from NYTimes, Jane Street, and Talos Principle. I am currently interested in developing a puzzle game. :)

Martial Arts
=====
I hold a second degree black belt in Japanese Jiujitsu and Ninjitsu (particularly Danzan-ryÅ« Jiujitsu) from Sensei Ryan Cary. In the past I used to teach martial arts lessons with an emphasis on weapons training and women's self defense. I love the three section staff!

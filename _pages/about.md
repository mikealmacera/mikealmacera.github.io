Good morning! My name is Mikeal (\[mikʰeɪɑl\]). I am a sophmore at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently taking a gap year, taking some courses in my hometown university, and exploring the world!

Current Whereabouts
======
I am a core staff and research assistant at the Davidson Foundation Nanofabrication Laboratory which recently opened this year. My roles include operational tasks, contributing to ALE research, and training new users on lithography and metrology. This fall I also work as a TA for UNR's freshman course on computer science and programming (CS 135).

This semester I will be studying machine learning, econometrics, automata theory, combinatorics, and compilers.

Previously
=====
Last Summer -- I officially started my position in the Davidson Foundation Cleanroom. I was trained on using a variety of machines from sputterers to maskless aligners to a hot plate with a rather unwieldy user interface. I learned different lithography processes and mask design softwares.
- I took a formal course on programming language pragmatics and took a graduate course on operating systems.
- I mentored incoming freshman in the Liberal Arts college.

Last Semester -- I studied Real Analysis, Operations Research, Deep Learning, and Linguistics.
- Thanks to Jo and Avik from the X Lab for organizing and flying me out to the Chicago Symposium for Transformative AI!
- I wrote a paper on the Quechua Language! Will upload here soon.
- I wrote a paper on Seidel's Algorithm and an introductory lecture on Linear Programming. Will also upload them here soon.

A long time ago -- I enrolled in CMU
- I became an executive for the Carnegie AI Safety Initiative and a Committee Chair for CMU IEEE.
- Regarding CASI, I taught BlueDot’s course on AI Governance in Fall '24.
- I studied Universal Gate Quantum Programming and Quantum Machine Learning from Daniel Justice and Prof. Rita Singh.
- I was an organizer for ACM's HackCMU hackathon.
- I assisted KAIST with research regarding HCI in online spaces, predominantly Discord!
- I studied Software Design and thought about going into HCI.
- I was one of the organizers for the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)'s Ideathon.

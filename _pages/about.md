My name is Mikeal (\[ mikʰeɪɑːl \]). I study mathematics, computer science, and linguistics. I am currently interested in how predictions from a modern language model relate to EEG responses during language comprehension. I also have intersts in various graph theory applications. I am pursuing a dual degree in Mathematics and the new Computational Linguistics program at the University of Nevada-Reno.

Current Whereabouts
======
This semester, I am studying operations research, linguistics, real analysis, and neural networks. I frequent events from ACM, IEEE, and the local chess club.
- I really love chess puzzles! I am currently in the Top 500 worldwide on Chess.com in the Chess Puzzles category. Going for the Top 100!
- I am interested in studying the Quechua language and to be able to speak it.
- One of my classes, STAT 775 - Linear Algebra and Learning from Data, covers Strang's new book of the same title. I highly recommend reading it!

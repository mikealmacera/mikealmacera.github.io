My name is Mikeal (\[ mikʰeɪɑl \]). I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computational Linguistics and Discrete Math. Currently obssessed with Explainable AI, financial decision-making models, and language acquisition using AI methods. I love to talk about AGI takeoff scenarios and AI Governance. In the past, I taught BlueDot’s course on AI Governance at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently taking a gap year (although I am still taking courses at my hometown university UNR.)

Current Whereabouts
======
This summer, I am studying Operating Systems, Data Structures, and Programming Language Pragmatics.

Currently reading: Programming Language Pragmatics (Scott, Aldrich), Types and Programming Languages (Pierce), Crafting Interpreters (Nystrom).

My name is Mikeal (\[ mikʰeɪɑl \]). I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computational Linguistics and Discrete Math. Currently obssessed with Explainable AI, financial decision-making models, and language acquisition using AI methods. I love to talk about AGI takeoff scenarios and AI Governance. In the past, I taught BlueDot’s course on AI Governance at Carnegie Mellon University.

Current Whereabouts
======
This semester, I am studying operations research, linguistics, real analysis, and neural networks. I frequent events from ACM, IEEE, and the local chess club.
- I really love chess puzzles! I am currently in the Top 500 worldwide on Chess.com in the Chess Puzzles category. Going for the Top 100!
- I am interested in studying the Quechua language and to be able to speak it.
- One of my classes, STAT 775 - Linear Algebra and Learning from Data, covers Strang's new book of the same title. I highly recommend reading it!

Last Semester Recap
=====
Last year, I took Prof. Daniel Justice's courses on Programming Universal Gate Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning from S3D @ CMU. I also served executive positions in CMU IEEE and CASI.

I currently moderate for the company Viggle AI. They run the second largest Discord server on the platform with more than four million members. Learn more about Viggle AI [here](https://viggle.ai).

I also moderate for BSTCHLD, a friend, livestreamer, and shortsmaker who is knowledgable about a specific kind of small business operations research. His server has more than 17,000 members.

In the past I have moderated for other content creators, friends, and companies. Examples include Roblox game development groups, YouTubers, cybersecurity companies, and communities for academic/educational resources.

My handle is 'gradescent.' Feel free to add me if you are interested in talking with me. I get a lot of requests and sometimes cannot see them all, so an email to connect would be further appreciated. Do not ask for me to do advertisements.
